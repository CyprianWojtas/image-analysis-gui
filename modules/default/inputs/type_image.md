# Image Input Element Documentation

## Overview

The Image Input enables users to select and upload image files directly from their local device or system to the Image Analysis Tool's interface. This functionality streamlines the process of importing images for analysis and facilitates seamless integration of user-provided image data into the tool's workflow.

## Features

- **File Selection**: Users can browse and select image files stored on their local device or system using the file selection dialog provided by the Image Input Element.
- **Preview Display**: Upon selection, a preview of the chosen image file is displayed within the Image Input Element, allowing users to inspect the image before uploading.
