Labels dictinct objects on the image

The Object Labeling Filter is an image processing technique used to identify and label distinct objects or regions within an image. This method is essential for tasks such as object recognition, segmentation, and analysis, providing a means to distinguish and label individual entities based on their spatial characteristics.

## How it Works

The process of object labeling involves the following steps:

1. **Image Segmentation:** The image is segmented to identify regions of interest, often using techniques like thresholding or contour detection.

2. **Connected Component Labeling:** Each segmented region is assigned a unique label, and pixels belonging to the same object share the same label. This step is crucial for distinguishing one object from another.

3. **Object Labeling:** The labeled image is generated, where each object or region is uniquely identified by its label. This labeled image can be used for further analysis or visualization.

## Applications

- **Object Recognition:** Identifying and distinguishing objects in an image.
- **Segmentation:** Dividing an image into meaningful regions for further analysis.
- **Computer Vision:** Providing a foundation for object tracking, analysis, and classification.

The Object Labeling Filter is a crucial component in various computer vision tasks, enabling the identification and differentiation of individual objects within an image. It serves as a fundamental step in higher-level image analysis and interpretation.
